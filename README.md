# AI_Based_Breast_Canser_Detection
Design and implementation of filter bank and Feature matrix of mammography images in order to integrate wavelet transform with artificial neural network in breast cancer diagnosis
tep one- pre-processing and processing of mammography images.
• Step two - wavelet transform.
• Step three - artificial neural network.
• Step four- model of the integration process of wavelet transform with artificial neural network.
• Step five - genetic algorithm.
• Step six- the process model of genetic algorithm integration with artificial neural network.
Cancer The aim of this article is to investigate the possibility of diagnosing breast cancer with neural networks
Multi-layer perceptron and convolutional neural network.
The multilayer perceptron neural network is almost as efficient as the convolutional neural network and
Convolutional neural network can show the results with higher accuracy.
Challenge one:
Design and implementation of technologies based on hybrid algorithms in the field of artificial intelligence
Cancer diagnosis is a very important step towards the advancement of medical science and medical engineering
Was.
Challenge two:
Medical engineering will be more successful if it can use effective methods based on
To combine experience with powerful artificial intelligence tools, therefore, a system is needed to help
Discovering existing patterns as well as predicting future events is completely emotional.
Due to the complexity of medical engineering issues, we must be able to use effective methods based on
Combine experience with artificial intelligence techniques and advanced engineering mathematics
show The goal of artificial intelligence is to develop paradigms with meta-heuristic algorithms for application
is human The purpose of this research is to use algorithms based on artificial intelligence
Similar to the digital medical image processing algorithm, the integrated wavelet transform algorithm
with the artificial neural network and in the second speech the integration of the artificial neural network algorithm
Genetic optimization is for early and timely diagnosis of breast cancer.
